# Configuration scripts

# DotFiles
* Zshconfig (Alias, Config options, Function, Paths, Widgets)
* Zshrc (Bundles all the config files)
* tmux_config (Bindings, Config options)
* tmux.conf (Bundles all the config files)

# To setup everything like i have it currently:
* cd ~/
* git clone git@github.com:Mvzundert/dotfiles.git
* cd ~/dotfiles/tools
* ./install.sh
* Grab a coffee and enjoy.

# PS
Current installer doesn't setup Tmux, you're going to have to manage that manually. =)
