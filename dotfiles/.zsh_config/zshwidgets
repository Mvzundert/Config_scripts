# Include Z, yo
# Z isn’t part of Oh-My-ZSH, but it’s the perfect companion for anyone who heavily uses the command line.
# The idea behind Z is that it builds a list of your most frequent and recent — “Frecent” — folders
# and allows you to jump to them quickly in one command,
# rather than having to tab through a nested folder structure

# Custom .zshrc source highlighting
# see: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
# Why must zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh be sourced at the end of the .zshrc file?
# zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh wraps ZLE widgets.
# It must be sourced after all custom widgets have been created (i.e., after all zle -N calls and after running compinit).
# Widgets created later will work, but will not update the syntax highlighting.
